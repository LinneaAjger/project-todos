# Project Todos

The assignment was to create an app with a todo list. It was to be built using Redux and react components.
## The problem

I did a design in Figma and made a plan of what kind of components and actions I wanted to use for my functions. I used some of my old projects to put all the pieces together and also found the live coding sessions really useful together with my teammates.
